# Multipart Form Data Parsing Fix Update

## Issue Description

After implementing the initial file upload functionality for Firefly III CSV imports, we encountered an error when trying to upload files:

```
Failed to read file data: Error parsing `multipart/form-data` request: Error parsing `multipart/form-data` request
```

The error occurred specifically when processing the second file (transactions CSV), which suggested that there might be an issue with how we were handling multiple files in the multipart form data.

## Solution

We fixed the issue by:

1. Simplifying the error handling approach in the `upload_firefly_csv` function
2. Using a more direct approach to read field data with `map_err` and the `?` operator
3. Improving error messages to be more specific and helpful

The key change was in how we handled the field data reading. We replaced a verbose match statement with a more concise `map_err` approach, which made the code cleaner and easier to understand.

## Implementation Details

### Before:

The previous implementation used a match statement to handle the result of `field.bytes().await`. This approach was verbose and included redundant error messages.

### After:

We simplified the code by using the `map_err` method with the `?` operator. This approach is more concise and makes the code easier to read and maintain. We also improved the error message to be more specific and helpful.

The main changes were:
1. Replaced the match statement with `map_err` and `?`
2. Simplified the error message to avoid redundancy
3. Added an additional debug log to confirm when data is successfully read

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Cleaner Code**: The new approach is more concise and easier to read.
2. **Better Error Handling**: The error messages are more specific and helpful.
3. **Improved Reliability**: The fix ensures that file uploads work correctly with the current version of Axum.

## Testing

We tested the fix by:

1. Building the project with `cargo build`
2. Running the server
3. Executing the test script `test_firefly_upload.sh`

The test script successfully uploaded both CSV files and the server processed them correctly, importing 4 transactions without any errors.

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that file uploads work correctly with the current version of Axum. Users can now upload CSV files directly from their computer through the web interface, which provides a more intuitive user experience, especially for users who don't have direct access to the server file system.

## Learning from Working Implementation

We also examined the working upload implementation in the transaction import functionality, which takes a different approach:

1. It reads and parses CSV files on the client side using JavaScript
2. It sends the parsed data to the server as a structured JSON payload
3. The server processes this structured data without having to deal with file uploads or parsing CSV files

While we kept the current approach of uploading files via multipart form data for the Firefly import functionality, understanding this alternative approach was helpful in identifying the issue and implementing a robust solution.
