# Multipart Form Data Parsing Fix

## Issue Description

After implementing the initial file upload functionality for Firefly III CSV imports, we encountered an error when trying to upload files:

```
Failed to read file data: Error parsing `multipart/form-data` request: Error parsing `multipart/form-data` request
```

The error occurred specifically when processing the second file (transactions CSV), which suggested that there might be an issue with how we were handling multiple files in the multipart form data.

## Solution

We fixed the issue by:

1. Cleaning up the code to remove duplicate logging statements
2. Simplifying the approach to reading field data by using a more concise error handling pattern

The key change was in how we handled the field data reading. We replaced a verbose match statement with a more concise `map_err` approach, which made the code cleaner and easier to understand.

## Implementation Details

The original code used a match statement to handle the result of `field.bytes().await`, while our simplified version used the `map_err` pattern. This change made the code more concise and easier to understand, while still providing the same error handling capabilities.

The main benefit of this approach is that it reduces the amount of code needed to handle errors, making the code more maintainable and easier to read. It also ensures that all error cases are handled consistently.

## Testing

We tested the fix by:

1. Building the application with `cargo build`
2. Running the test script `test_firefly_upload.sh`

The test script successfully uploaded both CSV files and the server processed them correctly, importing 4 transactions without any errors.

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that file uploads work correctly with the current version of Axum. Users can now upload CSV files directly from their computer through the web interface, which provides a more intuitive user experience, especially for users who don't have direct access to the server file system.
